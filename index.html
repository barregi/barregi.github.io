        	<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>My name is Be&ntilde;at Arregi and in this website I present my professional activity.</p>
			<p>Since I graduated as an architect in 2007, my focus has increasingly shifted into research in construction technology, more specifically in modelling, evaluating and optimising the thermal and hygrothermal performance of building envelopes. I was a core member of Building Life Consultancy in Dublin from its inception in 2009, where I worked in modelling, evaluating and optimising the hygrothermal performance of building envelopes in close relation with manufacturers, suppliers, universities and public bodies of Ireland and the UK.</p>
			<p>In 2016 I joined Tecnalia, where I currently work as a full-time researcher within the Building Technologies Division, involved in research and innovation projects of both regional and international scope. I am also a part-time lecturer within the MSc in Building Performance of the Dublin School of Architecture.</p>
			<p>My current activity is focused on the development of models and data analysis methods for describing the thermal performance of passive, active and adaptive building envelope assemblies. Building on this topic, I have recently started a PhD with Tecnun, the School of Engineering of the University of Navarra.</p>
